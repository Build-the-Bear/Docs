!!! warning
    Document under construction and subject to change. Additional resources and diagrams coming soon

So you're looking to mint some NFTs on an EVM blockchain, eh? We can get you squared away. First thing's first... what are you planning to mint?

### **:material-package-variant: Choose your concept**

Following are some questions you may want to ask yourself:

- **What will your token(s) be used for?**
    * _Vanity? Private access? Yield farming? Trading? Collecting? Historical references?_
- Do you intend to publish a collection? Maybe just a handful of NFTs? One?
    * _Complexity and potentially useful toolsets can vary greatly depending on the scope of your project_
- What media/metadata will you use?
    * _Audio/Video NFTs, Collectibles/Traits, Custom data/JSON, etc._

### **:fontawesome-solid-road-bridge: Choose your path **

There are many paths to minting NFTs; both free and paid tools are available, with all variety of customizations.
However, publishing your own contract is almost as simple as using those tools... provided you know what you're looking at; let's talk about it.

!!! info
    Be sure that you have an understanding of the difference between on-chain and on-site NFTs. Depending on the platform, you may or may not be interacting directly with the blockchain on every transaction

So you've got a concept...

- Do you just want to mint something?
    * _The most widely used platforms support many of the options you may be considering, and may be the path of least resistance - [OpenSea :material-book-arrow-up-outline:](https://opensea.io/), [NiftyKit :material-book-arrow-up-outline:](https://niftykit.com/)_
    * _There are other NFT minting apps with various strengths, but try to stay away from less known tools until you've done your due diligence_
- Do you want to be in control of the minting process?
    * _You could roll your own interface, or use a combination of third-party tools/embedded actions. The two platforms listed above can handle most of what you'd need_   
- Do you know what type of NFT(s) you want to mint?
    * _Traditional specification - [EIP-721 :material-book-arrow-up-outline:](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)_
    * _Royalty specification - [EIP-2981 :material-book-arrow-up-outline:](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981)_
- Do you want control of the contract?
    * _If you don't want to manage the overhead, or would prefer to avoid technical burden of any sort... a platform may be best suited for your needs_
    * _If you **DO** want to deploy your own NFT contract, See [Further Reading](#further-reading)_
