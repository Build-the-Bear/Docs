# **:material-account-cowboy-hat: How to Deploy Contracts**
!!! warning
    Document under construction and subject to change. Additional resources and diagrams coming soon

Deploying smart contracts is easy... ensuring they function as intended is the hard part. Seems like there's a de-peg, bridge exploit, flash loan, or exchange meltdown every week around here. 

### **:material-check-network-outline: Configure your network **

Go ahead and get yourself set up on the testnet of your choice; you should be able to add a new network connection 
in your wallet settings, then find a faucet to fund your wallet (yes, you may need to do a little research)

??? example
    === "Mainnet"
    
        ``` 
            RPC: https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161
            Chain ID: 1
            Symbol: ETH
            Explorer: https://etherscan.io
        ```
        
    === "Testnet"
    
        ``` 
            RPC: https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161
            Chain ID: 11155111
            Symbol: ETH
            Explorer: https://sepolia.etherscan.io
        ```

### **:material-developer-board: Configure your IDE **

For your first couple contracts, you'll need nothing more than a little tool called [Remix :material-book-arrow-up-outline:](https://remix-project.org/)

Remix allows you to develop, debug, and deploy contracts with no setup required. They offer both web and desktop versions; with plugins to make the process even easier.

- Coming soon: Available tools, recommended plugins, other useful software

### **:material-newspaper-variant-multiple-outline: Configure your contract details **
- Coming soon: Official specifications/contract repos, tips on organization/readability, contract verification
